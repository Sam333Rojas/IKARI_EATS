# IKARI_PRO_EATS: On-demand Delivery Web App
### Made using Django, JavaScript and Bootstrap (Deployed in AWS EC2 instance)

> Note: due to the timing and my knowledge of GIT at the time of project creation the full version of the project is in the "adelanto" branch.

As a final project for the subject of Data Structures (Subject directed by professorDavid Herrera) in the National University of Colombia, I developed a web application clone of Uber Eats in order to challenge myself within an interest in geo-positioning(making use of the Google Maps API). Using Bootstrap to create a responsive interface, JavaScript(specially for the algorithm in charge of the selection of the nearest deliverer to the restaurant) Django(As backend framework for authentication and MVC) and PostgreSQL for the database.
